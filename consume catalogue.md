This subcommand shows you the list of the supported items you can drink and eat, their prices, and their intoxication modifiers. This includes HB items!

You can purchase an item via `!consume item-name`.

You can add new drinks and foods to an svar, and use those. You can find how to set up the svar [here](https://github.com/Adalwolf3333/Drinking-Eating-and-Intoxication/tree-save/main/Example%20Homebrew%20Consume)! When you make it, you can do `!consume hb item-name` to consume the item.
