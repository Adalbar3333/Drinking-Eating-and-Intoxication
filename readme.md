Version 2.2.1 - Coinpurse support:
Thanks, Byronius for adding the code to support the use of both the cvar and game version of coins as well as applying list comprehension to the coins display!

Version 2.2.2 - Server Settings:
This update will give you some more customizability; More space for your Homebrew Items, Removal of Standard Items, and a comprehensive guide to making your lists for your homebrew items will soon be available. 

Version 3.0 - Tavern Owners:
You can now set up taverns to have custom menues, then also collect coin for your tavern. There is a Tax variable. This could also be invisioned as *paying workers*. Any suggestions, please leave them in the GitHub! 

This alias helps add an element of intoxication and fun to your game via drinks and food.
