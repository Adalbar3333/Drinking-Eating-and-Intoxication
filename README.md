Here's my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/adalbar3333)
You can make issue requests to suggest new drinks and foods to add to the alias. When you make a pull request, please leave the following: Item Name, Drink or Food, Cost, Intoxication Modifier, a simple 1-2 sentence description, and if you want to be notified that the new item as been added please add you discord username. 

The current items are as follows. 

You can see all added content in the Added-Content Branch

The Alias now automatically removes and exchange coins when you do not have the correct coin for it. 

The Alias now allows for you to ignore the coins via `-i`, `free`, or `ignore` so the bot dose not remove the coin if you have the argument.
