Each drink and food affects your intoxication level differently due to its alcohol content, or its absorbing traits. Type `!consume list` to see the potency of the different drinks you can use as well as their monetary cost.\nYour first drink past that limit will force you to make a `Constitution Saving Throw`, with an Initial `DC` of 10. Every drink past this one will increase the `DC` by `2`. Eg, 2nd drink means `DC 12`, 3rd means `DC 14`, etc. Food will decrease the the DC by 2. Resistance to Poison will grant you `advantage` on these saves.\nHow drunk you get depends on how poorly you fail. If you miss the DC by less than 5, you take one point of drunkenness. If you miss by greater than 5, but less than or equal to 10, you gain 2 points of drunkenness. If you fail by greater than 10, you gain 3."'''
